2. Installation Instructions
Whether you include an installer for your software or not, you should include a document that instructs the user how to install your software and launch it. This document can be part of your user manual, or it can be a separate document. Either way, the instructions for installing your software should be prominently located in your user documentation. You should include the following information (at a minimum):
1. System requirements
2. Installation instructions
3. Any known issues that might affect installation or use
4. Basic troubleshooting if the software won’t install
