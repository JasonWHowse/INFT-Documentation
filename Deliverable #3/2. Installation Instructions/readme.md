<h2>2. Installation Instructions</h2>
Whether you include an installer for your software or not, you should include a document that instructs the user how to install your software and launch it. This document can be part of your user manual, or it can be a separate document. Either way, the instructions for installing your software should be prominently located in your user documentation. You should include the following information (at a minimum):<br><br>
1. System requirements<br><br>
2. Installation instructions<br><br>
3. Any known issues that might affect installation or use<br><br>
4. Basic troubleshooting if the software won’t install
