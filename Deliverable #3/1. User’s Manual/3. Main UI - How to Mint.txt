If the user clicks the mint button the system will attempt to create a token for the file selected.  If the file exists in the system then the system will attempt to pin it to the IPFS network.  If this is successful then the system will create a toast message indicating success.  If any of the steps had failed a toast message will indicate what step it failed to accomplish.  The system will display all currently minted items in the combo box below the browse button.
