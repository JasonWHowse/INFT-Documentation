6. Weekly Status Reports

Your team is free to make its own schedule as far as the project goes. However, I do require that each team send me a brief status report once per week describing their progress. I have included this to help mitigate the damage due to inherent project risks such as:
•technical problems
•personnel changes; e.g., a student drops the course
•procrastination
•non-participation

Consider me the “department manager”, in charge of all the teams. If something is not working out within a team, for whatever reason, I need to know about it as soon as possible if I am to help the team overcome the problem.

To provide incentive for submitting these status reports, each weekly status report will be worth 5 points towards the overall course grade (not the project grade). I have allotted 12 weekly status reports for a total of 60 points.
