4. Tools and Standards

You should have a document that lists the various tools you used to build the project. This list should include things like programming language(s), editors, IDEs (Integrated

Development Environments, e.g. Visual Studio, Eclipse), design tools such as UML modeling tools, etc.

For standards, you should include things like the process model you plan to follow, along with any standards (e.g., coding standards, documentation standards, etc.) you plan to use.
