5. Configuration Management Plan

You should have a document that explains how you plan to maintain and keep track of the various versions you will end up developing. Be sure you clearly distinguish between your development versions and your release versions.

You need to have some kind of configuration management plan, since you will undoubtedly generate many versions of your software over the course of the semester. I suggest using something simple, like making a copy of the entire project folder for each new version, and using a numbering system like the standard major.minor.build or something similar. If you happen to run into storage problems while doing this, you can always prune the oldest versions from your hard drive and archive those to CD-ROM.

Whatever you do, you should always take care to make sure you keep a copy of versions that work. Many a project has been ruined by making one simple change that ended up cascading into a series of subsequent simple changes, to the point where the software became unstable, and the developer was unable to get back to the original, working version.
