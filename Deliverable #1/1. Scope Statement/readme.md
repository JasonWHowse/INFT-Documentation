<h2>1. Scope Statement</h2>
Before going full speed ahead on gathering requirements, you should establish the boundaries of the software you will build. These boundaries should be documented in a scope statement. Examples of things that establish software boundaries are:<br>
• What type of platform (Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, etc.) must the software work with?

• Will the software function as a standalone application on a given computer, or will it function over a network connection?

• What other software, if any, must the software interact with? For example, you might be building a subsystem component that will be integrated into a larger system. In such a case, it’s important that you don’t duplicate functionality provided by existing subsystems.

• If you are building a game, how many players will be supported? Will there be a computer player? If so, will it use artificial intelligence?

• What programming language will be used for the project?

• Will the software use a graphical interface or a command line interface?

Note that these are also part of the software requirements, and should therefore be included in your requirements document.
