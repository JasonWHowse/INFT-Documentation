What was accomplished?
IPFS get and pull methods developed allowing for all project elements is now easily implemented.

How each group member contributed to the project?
Jason Implemented IPFS get and pull methods on the front end.  Chris loaded and configured a mac dev environment to git hub.  Chris created a fronted application today that uses the Nft.Storage api.
Mat is researching methods for testing using unit tests on c# and solidity contracts.

What problems were encountered?
Configuring the API for the IPFS push was difficult because of a lack of documentation on how to correctly configure it.  I ultimately figured out how the system was expecting the API info.  I also had difficulties with implementing MIME and getting it to properly recognize different file types but ultimately got it to function.
