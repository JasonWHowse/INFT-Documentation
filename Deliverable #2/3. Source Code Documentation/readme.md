<h2>3. Source Code Documentation<h2>
You are free to use whatever code documentation standard you are most comfortable with. The code writers on your team should try to use the same documentation standard, if possible. The only stipulations I have are:
1. Your source code must be documented to receive full points for that part of the project.
2. You should indicate the traceability from your designs to your code, by including the identifier of each design component (which should correspond to the identifier of the appropriate requirement) in the header comments of the source code used to implement that component. For example:
>/**
* Query user for background pattern to use for cards
* (Requirement 1.1.0)
*/

public int getCardBackground();
