1.1 Purpose:
	The purpose of the documentation is to explain the requirements of the iNFT application.

1.2. Scope of the Product:
	The iNFT app will generate NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Ethereum network.

1.3. Glossary: 
	• Dapp - A decentralized application that uses a decentralized network (e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin).
	• Blockchain: An immutable, ledger database of transactions distributed across a network.
	• Crypto wallet: A tool that manages a collection of accounts, public keys, private keys, and interacts with a blockchain network.
	• Crypto Keys
		¤ Asymmetric cryptography involves pairs of keys.
		¤ Generation of Keys depends on the cryptographic algorithm.
		¤ The algorithm generates a private and public key
		¤ Depending on your use case, one key signs and encrypts messages, the other key verifies and decrypts messages.
	• Public address - A hash of the accoutn's public key.  An Ethereum public address is digested from a keccak256 hash function where the public key is the input.
	• Ethereum - A blockchain platform that facilitates cryptocurrency and smart contracts.
	• Ether - The cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain.
	• Gas - The fee required to conduct a transaction on the blockchain.
	• Smart contract - Self-executed code on the blockchain.
	• NFT - (Non Fungible Tokens) A smart contract that has a standard, transfers owndership, and mints unique tokens of a digital asset.  According to wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token, "NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a proof of owndership that is seperate from copyright."
	• IPFS - (Interplanetary File System) is an immutable file system, once an item is pinned to the IPFS network it cannot be removed.

1.5 Overview
	The rest of this document will go over the requirements of the iNFT in both general terms and more specific terms.
