<h2>1. Requirements Documentation</h2>
Detailed requirements are essential for building valid software (i.e., the software the customer wants). Your requirements should be as complete and as detailed as possible. You should organize your requirements in a sensible, hierarchical manner. Each requirement should be given a unique identifier that can be used to trace that requirement through the subsequent phases of the software life cycle. Your requirements document should follow the standard below, which is based on the IEEE/ANSI 830-1998 standard. For your requirements document, you do not need to include appendices (unless you have need to) or an index (an index would be nice, but unless you have a tool to generate an index automatically, this is too time-consuming).
<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
1.1 Purpose of the requirements document (You can ignore this one.)
1.2 Scope of the product — just use your scope statement from your project plan here<br>
1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations — list and define all of these that appear in your documentation<br>
1.4 References — include references for anything that is trademarked or copyrighted here (e.g., game instructions, algorithms such as the LZW compression algorithm for images, etc.)<br>
1.5 Overview of the remainder of this document (You can ignore this one.)<br>
<h4>2. General description</h4>
2.1 Product perspective — give a little background about why the software is being built and why it will be useful; one good paragraph will do<br>
2.2 Product functions — describe fundamentally what the software will do; again, one good paragraph will suffice, and you do not need to go in depth (the specific requirements section will cover the in-depth functions)<br>
2.3 User characteristics — describe who the end users will be<br>
2.4 General constraints — describe the general limitations of your software (e.g., system limitations, does not work over a network, etc.)<br>
2.5 Assumptions and dependencies — examples of these would be: assumes end user has QuickTime installed; requires Visual Basic runtime to be installed on end user's computer<br>
<h4>3. Specific requirements</h4>
Section 3, which deals with the specific requirements, will vary depending on the software being built. I suggest using a simple numbering scheme. Below I show a partial set of requirements for a poker game, using a similar system. These requirements are far from complete - they are simply provided as an example.<br>
<div style="background-color: yellow;margin-left: 50px;">
<h5>Playing Cards</h5>
1.0.0 The game should use a standard deck of 52 playing cards, with no jokers.<br>
1.1.0 User should be allowed to choose the design used for the card backs from 2 provided designs.<br>
1.1.1 Solid blue design should be provided.<br>
1.1.2 Red thatched design should be provided.<br>
1.2.0 Each non-face card should display the appropriate numerical value.<br>
1.3.0 Each non-face card should display the appropriate number of suit symbols.<br>
<h5>Game types</h5>
2.0.0 User should be allowed to choose the type of poker game they wish to play.<br>
2.1.0 The game should allow the user to play 5-card draw, according to standard rules.<br>
2.2.0 The game should allow the user to play 7-card stud, according to standard rules.<br>2.2.0 The game should allow the user to play 7-card stud, according to standard rules.<br>

<h4>4. Appendices</h4>
You don’t need to include appendices unless you feel they are warranted.<br>
<h4>5. Index</h4>
Do not bother including an index unless you have a tool that can automatically generate an index for a document. Otherwise this will be too time-consuming.
