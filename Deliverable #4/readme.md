4. Deliverable #4: The Final Product
This is the executable software, along with all data files, library files, drivers, and any other file necessary for the software to be used.
1. You should assume the end user might be someone who doesn’t necessarily have a lot of technical computer experience; i.e., usability is a high priority. Don’t make unfounded assumptions about the intuitive capacities of your end users.
2. You need to have an installer program that installs the application on the user’s computer. This can be a full-fledged installation wizard or a simple batch file, depending on the requirements of your application. Do not use a trial version of an installer, since they often only work for a limited period of time. There have been cases where I was unable to install students’ software because the trial installer they used had expired by the time they turned in their projects.
3. Depending on the size of your final project, you may be able to simply post it to Blackboard. If you do this, please package everything into a single zip file, and post the zip file. If your project is too large to post on Blackboard, you should make arrangements for a version that can be downloaded via some other means.
